# Create a function named every_other_letter that takes a string named word as a parameter. 
# The function should return a string containing every other letter in word.

# Write your every_other_letter function here:
def every_other_letter(word):
  every_other = ""
  for i in range(0, len(word), 2):
    every_other += word[i]
  return every_other

# Uncomment these function calls to test your tip function:
print(every_other_letter("Codecademy"))
# should print Cdcdm
print(every_other_letter("Hello world!"))
# should print Hlowrd
print(every_other_letter(""))
# should print
